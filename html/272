	 <h4 class="header">Remarks</h4>
	<div class="text"> This alliance has been expanded since 2009 from the <i>Rubus armeniacus </i>semi-natural shrubland to include other non-native shrubs to small trees that also can occur as thickets in mesic, riparian settings.  However, membership rules are needed for various regions of the state for the indicator taxa (especially for <i>Sesbania punicea </i>).<br/>
<br/>
<i>Rubus armeniacus </i> has a Cal-IPC rating of High. The species is native of western Europe, introduced to California by Luther Burbank as a new crop plant in 1885. Plants create sprawling, robust, spiny brambles to 3 m high with stems to 10 m long. Stems are biennial. Sterile first-year stems, called primocanes, develop from buds at or below the ground surface and bear leaves with three to five leaflets. The primocane tips can root when they hit the soil. During the second year, lateral branches, or floricanes, develop in the axils of the primocanes, and these flower and fruit and then die. Animals, especially birds and mammals, readily eat the fruit, a fleshy aggregate of druplets. Seeds get spread over considerable distances, and they develop a seed bank (DiTomaso and Healy 2007, Francis 2002b, Global Invasive Species Database 2006, Hoshovsky 2000a, Tirmenstein 1989e). Other botanical references use the names <i>R. discolor </i>and <i>R. procerus </i>for this species. <br/>
<br/>
<i>Rubus armeniacus </i>grows along riparian sites, mesic clearings, disturbed areas, and stock ponds throughout cismontane California. The native <i>R. ursinus </i>and non-native <i>R. armeniacus </i>have similar ecologies, and these species sometimes grow intermixed. Stands dominated by the aggressive <i>R. armeniacus </i>are extensive in many areas in northern California.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sesbania punicea </i>has a Cal-IPC rating of High. This species is native to South America, being brought to California as an ornamental plant, likely because of its showy, red to orange pea-like flowers and distinctive, 4-winged oblong seed pods. It is similar to a locust tree with long-pinnately compound leaves but is mult-branched and scrubby, only growing to about 3 m tall. It has escaped cultivation and has become established along rivers and other streams. Its seed pods can float, easily travel and establish new populations along riparian waterways, allowing this plant to spread rapidly. Dense stands can form after establishing with other detrimental effects: cutting off access to rivers and streams, overtaking native vegetation needed by wildlife, and leading to erosion and possibly flooding (DiTomaso et al. 2013). <br/>
<br/>
<i>Ficus carica </i>has a Cal-IPC rating of Low.  The species probably originated in western Asia and the Middle East (eastern Mediterranean), and it is widely grown throughout the world for its edible fruits. It has escaped cultivation in some regions of California and in most southern and eastern states of the U.S. This deciduous large shrub to tree grows to 7-10 m, and it has fragrant deeply lobed leaves. Its fruits are dispersed by birds and mammals, and it easily resprouts from its shallow roots. In riparian areas, it can form dense clonal thickets (Bossard et al. 2000, DiTomaso et al. 2013), and can expand rapidly over time once critical conditions are met (Holmes et al. 2013).<br/>
<br/>
Vegetation analysis in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River delta (Hickson and Keeler-Wolf 2007) suggested that the ecology of <i>R. armeniacus </i>is similar to the native <i>Rosa californica, </i>and analysis in the Sierra Nevada suggests this blackberry is similar to <i>Rubus laciniatus </i>and <i>R. ursinus </i>(Potter 2005) <i>. R. laciniatus </i>and three non-native roses (<i>Rosa canina, R. eglanteria, </i>and <i>R. mulitflora</i>) also infest similar vegetation and environmental conditions, but they are not encountered as commonly (DiTomaso and Healy 2007). <i>Rubus laciniatus, </i>cutleaf blackberry, has variously compound leaflets, whereas <i>R. ursinus, </i>a native, has three leaflets. The roses differ in sepal and thorn characteristics, and they should not be confused with the thicket-forming natives: <i>Rosa californica, R. nutkana, </i>and <i>R. woodsii. </i>We distinguish the native blackberry and rose brambles as separate alliances from the <i>Rubus armeniacus </i>type because of their differences in nativity and regional distributions, but further sampling and analysis are needed. <br/>
<br/>
Generally the most aggressive invader of natural habitat across California is <i>R. armeniacus </i>, though <i>Sesbania punicea </i>is found as an invasive shrub especially along the Sacramento-San Joaquin River delta. <i>Ficus carica </i> appears to be invading various streams in the Great Valley, its foothill tributaries, and in southern California; it invades riparian forests and excludes native vegetation, including in the San Joaquin Valley (Holmes et al. 2013). </div>

	<div class="text"><i>Rubus armeniacus </i>sprouts vigorously after fire or other disturbances and appears to grow best following disturbance. It invades recently burned and flooded sites. It has various regenerative structures located at or below the ground surface to enable this shrub to sprout when fire consumes the aboveground foliage, and sprouting through rooting stem nodes is likely if portions of the aboveground stem remain undamaged. In addition, most <i>Rubus </i>store seeds that remain viable for long periods in seed banks, and seeds germinate in abundance after disturbance (Tirmenstein 1989e). Based on the disturbance ecology of <i>R. armeniacus, </i>fire return intervals appear relatively short (< 10 years) in maintaining thickets.

Some of the largest stands of <i>Rubus armeniacus </i>observed occur along the Sacramento River between Cottonwood and Redding. More recent expansion of <i>Ficus carica </i> (especially in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys) and <i>Sesbania punicea </i> (especially along the American River and the delta) are of particular threat.</li>
        
            <li><b>Klamath Mountains</b> (M261Aa-c, Ae-f, Ah-i, Ak-m, Ar, Au). <i>Rubus armeniacus</i> is observed along streams below 1200 m and in disturbed areas.</li>
        
            <li><b>Mojave Desert</b> (322Af). Small stands of <i>Ficus carica </i>are found in Death Valley National Park with localized invasion in springs from previous plantings including with <i>Nerium oleander </i>.</li>
        
            <li><b>Northern California Coast</b> (263Aa-m). <i>Rubus armeniacus</i> grows in riparian habitats, mesic clearings, disturbed areas, and stock ponds throughout the Northern California Coast. In Sonoma County, <i>R. armeniacus</i> stands tend to be associated with riparian areas and moist pastures with recently reduced grazing pressure (Klein et al. 2015).</li>
        
            <li><b>Northern California Coast Ranges</b> (M261Ba-f). <i>Rubus armeniacus</i>, and rarely Ficus carica</i> and <i>Sesbania punicea</i>, are observed along streams below 1200 m and in disturbed areas.</li>
        
            <li><b>Northern California Interior Coast Ranges</b> (M261Ca-c). Stands of this alliance especially with <i>Rubus armeniacus </i>occur in wastelands, pastures, forest plantations, and along roadsides, streams, river flats, fence lines, and right-of-way corridors (Buck-Diaz et al. 2012).</li>
        
            <li><b>Sierra Nevada</b> (M261Ed-g, Em, Ep-q). Stands with <i>R. armeniacus </i>typically occur along streams below 1200 m with <i>R. ursinus, R. laciniatus,</i> and <i>Toxicodendron diversilobum </i>(Potter 2005).</li>
        
            <li><b>Sierra Nevada Foothills</b> (M261Fa-e).

Stands with the other indicator species of the alliance are localized in this section, e.g., the lower Stanislaus River, and along small creeks feeding into the American River near Placerville and near Folsom.</li>
        
            <li><b>Southeastern Great Basin</b> (341Ff). Small stands of <i>Ficus carica </i>are found in Death Valley National Park with localized invasion in springs from previous plantings.</li>
        
            <li><b>Southern California Coast</b> (261Ba-b, Bd-g, Bi-j). Reports of <i>Rubus armeniacus</i> and <i>Ficus carica</i> are  scattered throughout these subsections and are expected to form stands in some areas.</li>
        
            <li><b>Southern California Mountains and Valleys</b> (M262Ba-g, Bj-o). <i>Rubus armeniacus</i> and <i>Ficus carica</i> are observed along streams below 1200 m and in disturbed areas.</li>
        
            <li><b>Southern Cascades</b> (M261Da-c, Dj). <i>Rubus armeniacus</i> is observed along streams below 1200 m and in disturbed areas.</li>

	 <h4 class="header">Management Considerations</h4>
	<div class="text"> Mechanical removal and burning are the most effective ways of removing mature plants of <i>Rubus armeniacus; </i>however, plants aggressively sprout after disturbance. Use of herbicides in riparian areas requires focused use for complete removal, but some herbicides promote vegetative growth from lateral roots. Sheep and goats can control fresh growth in areas were mature plants are first removed (Francis 2002b, Hoshovsky 2000a, b, Tirmenstein 1989e). Plants produce large berry crops when growing in the sun. Without removal and with continued frequent disturbance, <i>Rubus armeniacus </i>is likely to increase compared to its native and ecologically similar relatives. 

<i>Sesbania punicea </i>can produce thousands of seeds per plant a year, and can quickly establish in dense stands making access impenetrable. It also can fix nitrogen and rapidly colonize areas, increasing soil nitrogen fertility, thus allowing other weeds to invade and thrive. Foliage, flowers, and seeds of <i>Sesbania punicea </i>contains chemicals called sesbanimides and saponins that are poisonous to humans, livestock, and wildlife when eaten. Mechanical removal is effective with hand-pulling of young plants and cutting of large plants to the ground. While stump sprouting can occur, cutting in combination with applying an herbicide or multiple cuttings have maximum effectiveness (DiTomaso et al. 2013).

<i>Ficus carica</i> is extensively planted for its delicious fruits in California, where it has escaped cultivation in riparian areas. Seedlings of <i>Ficus carica </i>can be mechanically removed, but established trees can easily resprout from roots and stems so mechanical removal is not effective. Herbicides may be an effective control late in the growing season (DiTomaso et al. 2013). Because <i>Ficus carica </i> can form dense groves that exclude native vegetation, they constitute a significant threat to riparian forests and shrublands. Holmes et al. (2013) found that it had an extended juvenile period and lag time before expanding rapidly, due to various intrinsic and extrinsic factors; they recommend managers of riparian areas work to eradicate even small populations of fig, especially source populations in riparian forests, because the fig has an ability to expand exponentially once established. </div>
